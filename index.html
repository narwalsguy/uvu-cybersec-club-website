        <p>HACK THE PLANET!</p>
        <p>As you can see, we’ve had our eye on you for some 
            time now, Mr. Anderson. It seems that you’ve been living two 
            lives. In one life, you’re Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for
             a respectable software company, you have a social security 
             number, you pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out 
             her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go 
             by the hacker alias Neo and are guilty of virtually every 
             computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a 
             future, and one of them does not. I’m going to be as forthcoming 
             as I can be, Mr. Anderson. You’re here because we need your help. 
             We know that you’ve been contacted by a certain individual, a man 
             who calls himself Morpheus. Now whatever you think you know about 
             this man is irrelevant. He is considered by many authorities to 
             be the most dangerous man alive. My colleagues believe that I am 
             wasting my time with you but I believe that you wish to do the 
             right thing. We’re willing to wipe the slate clean, give you a 
             fresh start and all that we’re asking in return is your 
             cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.</p>
